  "readme": "JavaScript port of the SimMetrics Java library plus more.\n===\n\nHand-optimized and re-factored to provide clean and fast string similarity algorithms for JavaScript developers.\n\nAlthough this is designed for Node.js, I will provide a browser version sometime in the future (or if anyone would like to contribute one).\n\nSo far, nearly all parts of the library have been ported. Algorithms left to be added are:\n\n\tSmithWatermanGotoh\n\tSmithWatermanGotohWindowedAffine\n\tTagLink\n\tTagLinkToken\n\nI should have those up very soon.\n\nA note I should make: I did not include the original timing tests for each one. I think they are unnecessary. However, as they can be useful sometimes, I will include them sometime as seperate modules which can be merged into the algorithms.\n\nSoundex Notes:\n\tSoundex works as an object created by new, in which case the normal soundex function is called as instance.soundex(input[, length]); OR you can simply call the Soundex function directly as Soundex(input[, length]);\n\n\tAlso, it does not include the hyphen between the leading letter and the soundex numbers.\n",
