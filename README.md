## Installation

In your project

```
npm install --save 'simmetrics-lodash'
```

## Usage

This module exports the file tree in `./lib` as an object, i.e. relative path
from `./lib` equals object path:

```js
var simmetrics = require('simmetrics-lodash');
var MogenElkan = simmetrics.similaritymetrics.MongeElkan;
â€¦
```

This is a further fork from [msamblet's version](https://github.com/msamblanet/SimMetrics.js), which is a fork from [novacrazy's version](https://github.com/novacrazy/SimMetrics.js). I'm focused on a few additional things:
- Make this library produce the same values as the java version (important!) So far this means better results for
	- ChapmanMatchingSoundex
	- Levenshtein
	- MongeElkan
	- SmithWatermanGotoh
	- NeedlemanWunch
- Automated testing
- Work with node.js
- Adding SmithWatermanGotoh metrics support.

## Changelog

### 0.8.13

Improved README

### 0.8.12

* Actually export the functions
* Fix syntax errors

### 0.8.11

* Fixed tests

### 0.8.10

combined with previous versions, the above focus points are in place (node.js
support, testing, certain metrics) and is now published as an npm module (and I
changed the name of the repo to match). This version just updates the readme.

## Usage

See the [test](https://github.com/lawrenae/simmetrics/tree/master/test) folder
--
[simmetrics.test.js](https://github.com/lawrenae/simmetrics/blob/master/test/simmetrics.test.js)
is a good place to start.

## Developer getting started

```
npm install
npm install -g mocha
```

and then to run all the tests:

```
mocha
```

##ToDo
1. The following metrics still seem to generate different answers than the java version, and need to be corrected.
   - EuclideanDistance
   - MatchingCoefficient
   - MongeElkan
   - OverlapCoefficient
   - QGramsDistance

## General Description

Hand-optimized and re-factored to provide clean and fast string similarity
algorithms for JavaScript developers.

Although this is designed for Node.js, I will provide a browser version
sometime in the future (or if anyone would like to contribute one).

So far, nearly all parts of the library have been ported. Algorithms left to be added are:

- TagLink
- TagLinkToken

I should have those up very soon.

### A note I should make:

I did not include the original timing tests for each one. I think they are
unnecessary. However, as they can be useful sometimes, I will include them
sometime as seperate modules which can be merged into the algorithms.

## Soundex Notes

Soundex works as an object created by new, in which case the normal soundex
function is called as `instance.soundex(input[, length]);` OR you can simply
call the Soundex function directly as `Soundex(input[, length]);`

Also, it does not include the hyphen between the leading letter and the soundex
numbers.
